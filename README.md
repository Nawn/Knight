# Knight
Practicing Search algorithms (In this instance, breadth first)

This was another learning project that I decided to build, again using a CLI to interact. The idea behind this project is that it's possible for the Knight in Chess to jump to every square on a Chessboard. Knowing that, I figured I could build a pathfinding algorithm to sketch out the path that would be taken from anyone one point to another. Source Code here.

##Installation
* Ruby installed
* `gem install terminal-table` For the ASCII board


Navigate to the directory you store in, and run `ruby knight.rb`
